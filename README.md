# NMZ Optimal Points
A plugin that uses coloured highlights and text to show players the optimal enemy to attack in NMZ.

Code is adapted from the NPC Highlight plugin.

Known issues:
- The normal scores for the Corrupt Lizardman, Elven Traitor and Essyllt were found by me as they weren't originally on the wiki, if you notice anything wrong with them let me know.       
- The highlighting doesn't work on Nazastarool's additonal forms         
- Not every boss has been tested, so please let me know if you encounter a boss that doesn't highlight
