# NMZ Optimal Points
A plugin that uses coloured highlights and text to show players the optimal enemy to attack in NMZ.

Code is adapted from the NPC Highlight plugin.

If you ever want to say hello in game my IGN is *MilkTrucker*.

Known issues:
- The highlighting doesn't work on Nazastarool's additonal forms
