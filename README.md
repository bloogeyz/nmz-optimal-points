# NMZ Optimal Points
A plugin that uses coloured highlights and text to show players the optimal enemy to attack in NMZ.

Code is adapted from the NPC Highlight plugin.

Known issues:
- The normal scores for the Corrupt Lizardman, Elven Traitor and Essyllt are not listed on the wiki, so are not currently accurate           
- The highlighting doesn't work on Nazastarool's additonal forms         
- Not every boss has been tested, so please let me know if you encounter a boss that doesn't highlight
